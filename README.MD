# Titanic - Survival Prediction

# Project Overview
This is the Titanic ML competition from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)  
According to Kaggle, ..."it's the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works."  

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

# Installation and Setup

## Codes and Resources Used

- **Editor Used:** Jupyter Lab
- **Python Version:** 3.11.7

## Python Packages Used

- **General Purpose:** warnings
- **Data Manipulation:** pandas, numpy
- **Data Visualization:** seaborn, matplotlib
- **Machine Learning:** scikit, sklearn

# Data

## Source Data
- [train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
    - from Kaggle's Titanic web page
- [test.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
    - from Kaggle's Titanic web page

## Data Acquisition
Simply navigate to the datasets using either link above and download the files.

## Data Preprocessing
Data required minimal preprocessing.  
The competition is setup to be a starter, "Hello World" type of introduction to Data Science/Machine Learning/Kaggle competitions.

# Results and evaluation
Work in progress

# Future work
Still a work in progress, however I may revisit this in the future and try again after I have more experience with competitions.
